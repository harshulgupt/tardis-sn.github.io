Haille Perkins is one of this year's Google Summer of Code contributors! She is a 3rd year graduate candidate in the Astronomy Department at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. At UIUC, her these work focuses on modeling kilonovae and rare core collapse supernovae to learn more about the nucleosynthesis involved in these events. As a GSoC contributor, she will be working on functionality to indicate spectral line features in TARDIS spectral visualizations.  Her work will enable simple comparisons with published, labeled spectra; a physical understanding of new models; and development of publication-ready plots.  Additionally, she will utilize `jax` to more efficiently compute Lucy (1999b) formal integral spectra, reducing computational cost for users.
